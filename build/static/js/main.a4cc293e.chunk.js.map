Located on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the city is approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern India and the main port of communication for North-East India.[19] According to the 2011 Indian census, Kolkata is the seventh-most populous city in India, with a population of 4.5 million residents within the city limits, and a population of over 14.1 million residents in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. It is the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. In 2021, Kolkata metropolitan area crossed 15 million registered voters. The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the cultural capital of India.[1][20]. In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,[21] the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post known as Fort William. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911. At that time, the British assessed its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, and moved the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement. Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of Indian commerce, culture, and politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation.[22] A demographically diverse city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to West Bengal's film industry Tollywood and cultural institutions, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum, and the National Library of India. Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four Nobel laureates and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city.[23] Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by focusing on association football and other sports.\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 3,\n    title: \"Mumbai\",\n    image: \"images/Mumbai/a3434ea6a272b73a521807a36d25d1ca.jpg\",\n    img1: \"images/Mumbai/451f65cd9bd4b8b855cca534dde6156f.jpg\",\n    img2: \"images/Mumbai/Mumbai_India_GettyImages-663507407.jpg\",\n    img3: \"images/Mumbai/xVg5t4.jpg\",\n\n    desc: \"Mumbai (English: /mʊmˈbaɪ/, Marathi: [ˈmumbəi]; also known as Bombay /bɒmˈbeɪ/— the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. According to the United Nations, as of 2018, Mumbai is the second-most populous city in the country after Delhi and the seventh-most populous city in the world with a population of roughly 20 million.[14] As per Indian government population census of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5 million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.[15] Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million.[16] Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city.[17][18] It has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India.[19][20] Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and the city's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings.[21][22]The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people.[23][24][25] For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of England.[26] During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,[27] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea.[28] Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.[29] Mumbai is the financial, commercial,[30] and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,[31] generating 6.16% of India's GDP,[32] and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT),[33] and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy.[34][35] Mumbai has the eighth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[36] and Mumbai's billionaires had the highest average wealth of any city in the world in 2008.[37][38] The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India.\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 4,\n    title: \"Delhi\",\n    image: \"/images/Delhi/india-new-delhi-government-parliament.jpg\",\n    img1: \"/images/Delhi/184-1849534_delhi.jpg\",\n    img2: \"/images/Delhi/1896134.jpg\",\n    img3: \"/images/Delhi/wp1891549.jpg\",\n\n    desc: \"Delhi (/ˈdɛli/; Hindi pronunciation: [ˈdɪlːiː] Dillī; Punjabi pronunciation: [ˈdɪlːiː] Dillī; Urdu pronunciation: [ˈdɛɦliː] Dêhlī),[15] officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.[16][17] It is bordered by the state of Haryana on three sides and by Uttar Pradesh to the east. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6] the second-highest in India after Mumbai,[18] while the whole NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7] Delhi's urban area is now considered to extend beyond the NCT boundaries, and include the neighbouring satellite cities of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area called the National Capital Region (NCR) and had an estimated 2018 population of over 28 million people, making it the world's second-largest urban area according to the United Nations.[8] Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Delhi either the most or second-most productive metro area of India.[11][19] Delhi is the second-wealthiest city in India after Mumbai and is home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires.[20] Delhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index.[13] Delhi has the second-highest GDP per capita in India.[10] Delhi is of great historical significance as an important commercial, transport, and cultural hub, as well as the political centre of India.[21] Delhi is one of the oldest cities in the world, and has been continuously inhabited since the 6th century BCE.[22] Through most of its history, Delhi has served as a capital of various kingdoms and empires, most notably the Tomars, Chahamanas, Delhi Sultanate and Mughals. It is also assumed to be the location of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata. The city has been captured, ransacked and rebuilt several times, particularly during the medieval period, and modern Delhi is a cluster of a number of cities spread across the metropolitan region. For many centuries Delhi has been a dominant trading and commercial centre in northern India, and since the 1990s it has emerged as an important node in the international corporate and financial network.[23] Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, 1982 Asian Games, 1983 NAM Summit, 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, 2010 Commonwealth Games, 2012 BRICS Summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region (NCR), which is a unique 'interstate regional planning' area created by the National Capital Region Planning Board Act of 1985.[24][25]\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 5,\n    title: \"Assam\",\n    image: \"/images/Assam/assam-tea-plantation-landscape-78977577.jpg\",\n    img1: \"/images/Gangtok/best-place-5b8efd25192f310.jpg\",\n    img2: \"/images/Gangtok/Tsomgo-Lake.jpg\",\n    img3: \"/images/Gangtok/Nathula-Pass.jpg\",\n\n    desc: \"Gangtok Nepali: [ˈɡantok]) is a city, municipality, the capital and the largest town of the Indian state of Sikkim.
